# A project that joins Control-M, or any other job scheduling system, to the
# KFS Batch Invoker
#
# Rhubarb's main purpose is to drop a runfile for the Invoker to pick up, wait
# for a corresponding statusfile, and return whether or not the job apparently
# succeeded. These activities are carried out by the {Rhubarb::Driver}.
#
# Secondarily, Rhubarb is capable of logging activities, rolling log files, and
# potentially notifying via email.
#
# Rhubarb is designed to be primarily used as a small set of binaries that can
# be executed by Control-M, or any job scheduling system.
