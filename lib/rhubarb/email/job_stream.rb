# Internal: A class that represents the email delivery functionality for a job stream.
#           This class is responsible for instanciating an email output and 
#           controls the email delivery flow for one or all output reports.
#
# Instance Variables:
# @name    - String representing the name of the job stream. For example archibus.
# @outputs - A hash with the name of each output report as the key and
#            corresponding output object as the value.
#

  # Public: Initializes the JobStream object. It will loop through all outputs in an
  #         email configuration yaml file and instantiate a corresponding email output
  #         message object to build the @outputs hash.

  # config  - A hash with the email configuration.

  #         a message for a single output target or we can deliver all messages.

  #                      the all keyword or the name of an output defined in the configuration
  #                      yaml.

  #
  # method - This is the method we would like to set. This is used in test mode
  #          to change the delivery method to :test so it does not actually send
  #          the email.
